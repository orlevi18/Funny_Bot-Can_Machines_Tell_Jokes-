# FunnyBot - Can Machines Tell Jokes?
Taking up on Open-AI Requests for Research: [Train a language model on a jokes corpus](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#funnybot)

An implementation of word-level LSTM in TensorFlow trained on a 200k English jokes dataset.

Recurrent-Neural-Networks have been used to generate [Shakespeare text, baby names and even music chords](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). However, generating jokes might be much more challanging due to the complexities of human humor.

Work in progress - (hopefully) funny jokes to follow!
